Task Analysis

Goal
– Our goal is to create an application so that users can easily see their portfolios, net gross, money   status, shared market values and related news, which connects your shared market data, as well as all    the accounts you have so that all of your money applications can be reduced to one, so that you don’t have to use many applications.

Preconditions
– Our user interface must know name, surname, password and email to create account, phone number is optional. To make transations you need to login via E-Devlet and your bank account to enable, or you can use our application without any information about your bank accounts like a wallet app, but this means that you cannot do any transations or buy, sell a shared market.
